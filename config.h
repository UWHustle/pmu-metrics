* Choose performance events to count. You can choose up to the
* available number of PERFEVTSEL MSRs (setting N_PERFEVTSEL_MSR above).
*
* Note that seven architectural performance events are available on all
* Intel PMU. See perf_events.h, first three events are fixed counters.
*
* For other performance events, you need to know the architecture
* family of your processor. You can obtain this information as follows:

node:~> cat /sys/devices/cpu/caps/pmu_name
skylake

* Depending on the architecture family, you can choose from the diverse
* set of available non-architectural events. Refer to Chapter 19 of the
* Intel Developer's Manual Vol. 3B for available events for your CPU's
* architecture family. For Skylake and Kaby Lake microarchitectures,
* a select few events have been included in perf_events.h. A full list of
* events for Skylake and Kaby Lake are present in Table 19-3 of the
* Intel Developer's Manual Vol. 3B.
*
* For instance, on a Skylake architecture, we've chosen the following
* three performance events:
- L3 Misses (architectural event)
- L2 Misses (non-architectural event, specific to Skylake and Kaby Lake)
- L1 Misses (L2 References, non-architectural event)
